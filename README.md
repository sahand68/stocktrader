# Stock Trader

A sophisticated stock trading system that uses machine learning models (LSTM and XGBoost) to predict stock market movements and make trading decisions.

## Features

- Multiple ML models support (LSTM and XGBoost)
- Real-time stock data processing
- Advanced technical indicators
- Model training and evaluation pipeline
- Interactive web interface for trading
- Visualization tools for market analysis
